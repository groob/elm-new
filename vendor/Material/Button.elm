{-| From the [Material Design Lite documentation](http://www.getmdl.io/components/#buttons-section):

> The Material Design Lite (MDL) button component is an enhanced version of the
> standard HTML `<button>` element. A button consists of text and/or an image that
> clearly communicates what action will occur when the user clicks or touches it.
> The MDL button component provides various types of buttons, and allows you to
> add both display and click effects.
>
> Buttons are a ubiquitous feature of most user interfaces, regardless of a
> site's content or function. Their design and use is therefore an important
> factor in the overall user experience. See the button component's Material
> Design specifications page for details.
>
> The available button display types are flat (default), raised, fab, mini-fab,
> and icon; any of these types may be plain (light gray) or colored, and may be
> initially or programmatically disabled. The fab, mini-fab, and icon button
> types typically use a small image as their caption rather than text.

clicked, `False` otherwise.

{-| From the
[Material Design Specification](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-flat-buttons):

> Flat buttons are printed on material. They do not lift, but fill with color on
> press.
>
> Use flat buttons in the following locations:
>
>  - On toolbars
>  - In dialogs, to unify the button action with the dialog content
>  - Inline, with padding, so the user can easily find them

Example use (uncolored flat button, assuming properly setup model):

    import Material.Button as Button

    flatButton : Html
    flatButton = Button.flat addr model Button.Plain [text "Click me!"]

-}
flat : Address Action -> Model -> List Style -> List Html -> Html
flat = view ""


{-| From the
[Material Design Specification](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-raised-buttons):

> Raised buttons add dimension to mostly flat layouts. They emphasize functions
> on busy or wide spaces.
>
> Raised buttons behave like a piece of material resting on another sheet â€“
> they lift and fill with color on press.

Example use (colored raised button, assuming properly setup model):

    import Material.Button as Button

    raisedButton : Html
    raisedButton = Button.raised addr model Button.Colored [text "Click me!"]

-}
raised : Address Action -> Model -> List Style -> List Html -> Html
raised = view "mdl-button--raised"


{-| Floating Action Button. From the
[Material Design Specification](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html):

> Floating action buttons are used for a promoted action. They are distinguished
> by a circled icon floating above the UI and have motion behaviors that include
> morphing, launching, and a transferring anchor point.
>
> Floating action buttons come in two sizes:
>
>  - Default size: For most use cases
>  - Mini size: Only used to create visual continuity with other screen elements

This constructor produces the default size, use `minifab` to get the mini-size.

Example use (colored with a '+' icon):

    import Material.Button as Button
    import Material.Icon as Icon

    fabButton : Html
    fabButton = fab addr model Colored [Icon.i "add"]
-}
fab : Address Action -> Model -> List Style -> List Html -> Html
fab = view "mdl-button--fab"


{-| Mini-sized variant of a Floating Action Button; refer to `fab`.
-}
minifab : Address Action -> Model -> List Style -> List Html -> Html
minifab = view "mdl-button--mini-fab"


{-| The [Material Design Lite implementation](https://www.getmdl.io/components/index.html#buttons-section)
also offers an "icon button", which we
re-implement here. See also
[Material Design Specification](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-toggle-buttons).
Example use (no color, displaying a '+' icon):

    import Material.Button as Button
    import Material.Icon as Icon

    iconButton : Html
    iconButton = icon addr model Plain [Icon.i "add"]
-}
icon : Address Action -> Model -> List Style -> List Html -> Html
icon = view "mdl-button--icon"
