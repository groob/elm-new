{-| From the
[Material Design Lite documentation](http://www.getmdl.io/components/#layout-section/grid):

> The Material Design Lite (MDL) grid component is a simplified method for laying
> out content for multiple screen sizes. It reduces the usual coding burden
> required to correctly display blocks of content in a variety of display
> conditions.
>
> The MDL grid is defined and enclosed by a container element. A grid has 12
> columns in the desktop screen size, 8 in the tablet size, and 4 in the phone
> size, each size having predefined margins and gutters. Cells are laid out
> sequentially in a row, in the order they are defined, with some exceptions:
>
>   - If a cell doesn't fit in the row in one of the screen sizes, it flows
>     into the following line.
>   - If a cell has a specified column size equal to or larger than the number
>     of columns for the current screen size, it takes up the entirety of its
>     row.

Example use:

    import Material.Grid exposing (grid, cell, size, Device(..))

    top : Html
    top =
      grid []
        [ cell [ size All 4 ]
            [ h4 [] [text "Cell 1"]
            ]
        , cell [ offset All 2, size All 4 ]
            [ h4 [] [text "Cell 2"]
            , p [] [text "This cell is offset by 2"]
            ]
        , cell [ size All 6 ]
            [ h4 [] [text "Cell 3"]
            ]
        , cell [ size Tablet 6, size Desktop 12, size Phone 2 ]
            [ h4 [] [text "Cell 4"]
            , p [] [text "Size varies with device"]
            ]
        ]

# Cells

Cells are configured with a `List Style`; this configuration dictates the
size, offset, etc. of the cell.

padding on either side. Width must be a valid CSS dimension.

encapsulates a screen size.)

one. On devices of type `Device`, leave `Int` columns blank before the present
one begins.

module defines various styles to set size, offset, etc. of the cell.
